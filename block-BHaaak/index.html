            <h5>Tired of your too, too solid flesh? Mild-mannered inventor Ray Kurzweil tells you how to scan your
                mind into a computer and live forever!!!</h5>
            <p>Struggling to find time in a busy schedule for yet another interview, Ray Kurzweil jokes that the
                media frenzy surrounding him these days only happens “every thousand years.” That’s because the
                inventor and entrepreneur who brought us such products as the Kurzweil electronic keyboard, a
                text-to-speech reading machine for the blind and voice-recognition software is also one of the most
                audacious-and, some say, accurate-futurists around. Kurzweil’s fearlessly detailed predictions make
                his latest book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, a must-read for the turn of the millennium.</p>
            <p>TR Associate Editor Rebecca Zacks visited Kurzweil at the Wellesley Hills, Mass., offices of Kurzweil
                Technologies, one of the half-dozen high-tech companies he has founded since selling his first major
                enterprise to Xerox in 1980. The son of a composer and trained as an MIT undergraduate in both
                computer science and creative writing, Kurzweil moves deftly from music and art to computer
                processors and nanotechnology to immortality, evolution and God. And though his manner and his gray
                pinstriped suit are remarkably subdued, his ideas about the future are explosive.</p>
            <div>
                <h5>We’re asymptotically approaching God?</h5>
                <p>But never reaching it. By the end of the 21st century, nonbiological intelligence will be
                    trillions of trillions of times more powerful than human intelligence. That’s hard for us to
                    imagine, and maybe from the human perspective, it’s virtually infinite. But from a literal
                    mathematical perspective, it’s still finite, so we can consider God as an ideal that evolution
                    never reaches.</p>
